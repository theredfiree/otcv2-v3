v2 from September 28 2021, listed as fixed damage calc and pred

DT Rar Notes:
Alsochanged the color of the elements to purple to make it stand out somehow.
The archive contains 3dllki.
In the first,doublet-up is acceleratedby 1 tick,in the second by 2, in the third by 3 ticks.
2 and 3 ticks may not be able to fire from pistols and deagle if you shoot with a manual, but in general, if you play on DM, everything is fine.
To playon DM I recommend 2-3 ticks,on public 2 ticks,on KV 1 tick.
At 3 ticks, you need to turn off custom AA, because it will punch and unregister.
In dllke with an acceleration of 1 tick, everything regains perfectly, and dt boosts a lot .
In the crack, by default, the number of ticks on the scar is 12, and on the digle and pistols 9

Kfg must be loaded after loading onto the card! When changing a card, load a clean config!
If it still crashes, turn off the skinchanger.
For people with dementia: this is not a 1-tick dt. It takes the speed dt and increases it by 1 or 2 ticks.
If the boost is not present, then re-boot configuration
(possibly broke DoubleTap, which is not the Instant (without teleport))
